# LaTeX Equations
Equations on this site are represented in a mark up language called MathML. However, the equations themselves were modeled using an established format for publishing
called LaTeX. LaTeX is supported by a host of tools including Apple Pages, Microsoft Word, etc. The main equation looks like the following in LaTeX:
## Left Side (Merry Christmas)
`\left[y=\frac{ln(\frac{x}{m} - sa)}{r^2}\right]^3` 
## Right Side (Happy New Year)
`ln\left(\frac{e^{a_r}+p^2 H_a}{N}\right)=W-ln(y)`

Links to the equation converter used for the project are included on the website.
