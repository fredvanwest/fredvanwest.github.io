# Welcome to Mathemajickal by Fred van West

## First off, what is the meaning of Mathemajickal?
Well the term "mathemajickal" is a neoligism consisting of the words Math (from Mathematics) and Majick (the ancient spelling of Magic). This is a concession to the quote::

```Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. -- Arthur C. Clarke ``` https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws

## Okay, so what does it mean?
So, if you've visited the home page, you'll know what it all means. This is a simple nerdy 'flex' that expresses a holiday greeting.  The intent is for friends, family and even strangers to scan the 
QR code, arrive at the home page and watch the holiday video greeting. More curious people might delve into the proofs. Attribution is given as well since no one works alone.

## I see, well how does the Augmented Reality experience work?
Augmented Reality (AR) allows your cell phone (or perhaps PC or Tablet device) to scan the images where the proofs and greeting pop up. This adds a little whimsy on top of the home page.

## Don't I need to download an app? I hate cluttering my phone with sparsely used apps and I don't want to have to hunt for it or download it over and over.
Rest assured, this experience does not require a separate application be downloaded. The AR Experience relies on open web standards such as AR.js and MathML so everythning renders within the browser
and there's no need to download anything new. The video is hosted here and does not rely upon a sharing service such as YouTube, though a YouTube hosted video will be posted to point people to this site.

## Can I see how the code works?
All of the code to render the equations and to present the AR experience are made freely available for your review. The technology is very light and should be relatively easy for someone to discover and learn to
customize for themselves if they choose.

```The future is programmable. -- Fred van West```
